                            <p>Mathru Devo Bhava! Pithru Devo Bhava ! Acharya Devo Bhava!</p>
                            <p>Sri Shirdi Sai Baba&rsquo;s Disciple,Worshipper (Upasak), Sri Laxmoji Ventrapragada was born on May 6, 1968 in Andhra Pradesh to Punya Dampatulu Late Sri Lokanadha Rao and Smt. Sarojini Devi. His father was commendably served as the Deputy Director of Animal Husbandry in erstwhile Andhra Pradesh state and left his earthly body on July 6th,2013. His mother is now resides with their 2nd eldest son Sri. Daya Sagar who is an advocate in Hyderabad (Telangana State) . He has a twin brother Sri Ramoji Ventrapragada resides in San Diego, California also a Shirdi Sai Baba devotee and is loved existentially by Sri Laxmoji.</p>
                            <p>On account of divine blessings and destiny, Sri Laxmoji became a citizen of Canada and then in course of time relocated to California, USA to take up a senior role in Information Technology field. He has a Masters in Commerce and a Cost Accountancy (ICWA) degree from the Institute of Cost Accountants of India. He is blessed with a loving and spiritually inclined family. His wife Smt Padmavati Gajula (Sridevi) is pious and devout lady supportive of his spiritual endeavors and his son Sai Rithvik (Sai) is balancing studies and devotion with aplomb.</p>
                            <p>Sri Laxmoji from his childhood was spiritually inclined. He immensely liked Hindu God, lord Vishnu as well as his incarnations/avatars of lord Rama and lord Krishna and had a very special bond and devotion towards both of them. A significant credit for seeding this love and devotion should go to his mother who read Shri Ramayana, Shri Mahabharata and Shri Mahabhaghavatha for him during his childhood. His childhood was a simple and peaceful affair like most other children of his age growing up in India.</p>
                            <p>With divine blessings of Shri Maha Vishnu, in the year 1986 while pursuing B. Com in Khammam (Telangana State) on advice of his mother Shri laxmoji Ventrapragada happened to read Shri Sai Leelamrutham, life story of Shri Shridi Saibaba with utmost attention and devotion . This Holy book was written by most respected Shri Acharya Ekkirala Bharadwaja master. This made him to completely understand about Shirdi Sai Baba, but in reality his first encounter with Shirdi Sai Baba was at the age of 13 years in the year 1981 when he saw Hindi movie &ldquo;Shirdi Ke Saibaba&rdquo; but he could completely comprehend the essence of the movie as he was too young.</p>
                            <p>After five years as a part of divine play, he once again read the life history of Shirdi Sai Baba. From the very first letter that he started to read, he developed an intense desire to see and talk to Shri Shirdi Sai Baba. He immensely liked Shirdi Sai Baba&rsquo;s appearance and dress code (Kafni and Head Gear). With each passing day his determination to communicate with Shirdi Sai Baba was strengthened. In that age when he was alone, he would look skywards and talk within himself asking Shirdi Sai Baba to appear before him. For attaining god&rsquo;s grace either eligibility and more so intense penance or else grievance is required isn&rsquo;t it? This moment came about sooner than expected in his life.</p>
                            <p>With divine blessings of Shirdi Sai Baba, he along with his twin brother Shri Ramoji and his close friend Shri Srinivas migrated to Hyderabad in 1987 to pursue ICWA (Cost and Management Accountant). Here with the help of his friend (Sri Srinivas), he got an opportunity to meet &ldquo;Spiritual Guru &amp; Mother&ldquo; Smt. Vani Codur who used to speak to Shri Sai and in turn blessed &ldquo;ME&rdquo; to serve Shri Sai Baba.</p>
                            <p>From that moment onwards, Guru Vanamma guided Shri Laxmoji in to Shri Shirdi Sai Path and several times instructed that Shirdi Sai has chosen him for his service and asked him to take Sai Deeksha and spread Sai Thathva (Sai way of life), but due to other pre-occupations, family commitments, pursuit of his education (ICWA) and as he was still not fully ripe to this idea he kept quiet.</p>
                            <p>Surprisingly, despite his best efforts, he failed ICWA exams serval times but in spite of this he did not pray to Baba or Vanamma to bless him to pass this exam. Specifically, he thought as to what is the need to express such mundane desire? He thought they are all pervasiveness and know everything. He always believed that that what we are eligible for, Sai Bhagwan would provide. But as final attempt in 1995, when he was preparing for exams residing at Hyderabad, KPHB Colony with his elder sister (Smt.Chamundeswari), early morning on the exam day, Shirdi Sai Baba gave a dream vision and announced that though he wanted to take him in his spiritual path but he is not ready yet. He stated that &ldquo;Today, I am letting you go but we will meet in near future&rdquo;. Expressing this, he disappeared. Those words remain impregnated in Shri Laxmoji Garu&rsquo;s mind even today.</p>
                            <p>To his utter amazement, in that exam attempt he passed the ICWA exam successfully and progressively settled in family and work life. 11 years later, when he completely surrendered his mind, words, and deeds at Baba&rsquo;s lotus feet (Sarvasvam Sharnagatham), Shri Shridi sai Baba, instructed Shri Laxmoji to serve him.</p>
                            <p>There was a miracle happened in Sri Laxmoji&rsquo;s life in the year of 1994, when his father was undergone for bypass Surgery after retirement from the service and taking rest in Khammam. Whole family was in deep financial crisis. Saibaba came to their home in the morning at around 9.30 AM in human form looks 70 years old exactly the way he was wearing Khafni and Turban and having Satka, Bowl and Jole (peace of cloth used to get alam) and blessed the family by materializing the fragranced holy water (Ganga) by squeezing Sphatik mala (Crystal chain) in front of Sri Laxmoji, his father, Mother , elder brother (Sri. Venu Gopala rao) and two younger sisters ( Smt. Umadevi &amp; Smt. Siva Jyothi) . Baba also materialized Vibhudi (Sacred Ash) and big Rose flower waving just only his 4 fingers of right hand and gave it all family members. Baba has spoken in Hindi and fondly called Sri Laxmoji as &ldquo;Beta&rdquo; (Son) and assured us that every thing will be alright. I am here and why do you fear. It was a blissful and mesmerized experience. Dried rose flower and Vibhudi are still kept in almarah locker even till today.Baba drank tea and break fast (Idly). Baba just disappeared as soon as he crossed the front gate of the house.</p>
                            <p>Guru Vanamma treated him like her own son, preached about essence of Guru Bhakti and Sai Marg (Sai&rsquo;s Path) while emphasizing the necessity to continuously practice and remain on this path. Neutralizing samskaras from past karmas and bad karmas, Guru Vanamma also made him walk on the path of Dharma leading to the lotus feet of Shri Sai Baba. In April 2006, in the presence of Sadguru Sai, Guru Vaniamma initiated him to Guru&rsquo;s path by making him take a pledge to serve Shri Sai lifelong.</p>
                            <p>From this moment onwards, with he divine blessings of Shri Shirdi Sai Baba and Guru Vanamma, he has been serving mankind with an eclectic mix of spiritualism coupled with service which is Sai Thathva. Spiritual activities include Sai Bhajans, Sat Charitra readings (Parayanams), Shri Sai Satsangs, Viswa Shanthi (Universal Peace) Homams, Shri Sai Satyanarayana Swamy Vrathams, Sri Sai Gayathri Maha Mantra Unison chantings across the Globe for World pease and Human wellbeing, Guru Poornima and Datta Jayanthi celebrations. Service activities include Feeding the hunger by donating Food, Clothes and Medicines, Education to Orphans, feeding the Cows, planting Trees. He performed such activities by grooming and including his fellow Sai Bhandus in this path of service with spiritualism thereby achieving existential bliss. He humbly and reverentially offers obeisance to the lotus feet of Shri Shirdi Sai Baba believes that all these tasks are devoted to god a real Karta, Karma and Kriya (real doer), who is doing it and he is a mere instrument of Shri Sai Baba in this delivery.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>With grace of Baba, in course of time Shri Laxmoji was able read life stories of Saints, and able to meet, interact and seek their blessings of great saints, mystics (Avadhutalu), and Gurus who had received the grace of Shri Shirdi Sai. among them are, Shri Satya Sai baba, Vishwamji Maharaj, Mysore Ganapathi Sachitananda Swamy, Mata Amrutanandamayi, Mataji Lakshmamma, Mataji Ramadevi, Shri Ekkirala Bharadwaja Master Garu, Ashok Maharaj, Shri Ramananda Maharishi and opportunity to visit several pilgrim places including Kashi, Shirdi, Haridwar, Tirupati, Gangapur, Akkalkota, Kurvapuram, Maniknagar, Simhachalam, Vijayawada Kanakadurga, Annavaram, Bhadrachalam , several Mosques, Churches and Sikh Temples. In all yogis and holy places, he only saw his Guru Shirdi Shirdi Sai Baba. In his view, all of them are manifestation of Shri Shridi Sai Baba. He worships Shri Shirdi Sai Baba, sees Shirdi Sai Baba as a personification of all gods and adopts Shri Shirdi Sai Baba&rsquo;s Tattvam with a feeling of ecstasy. Sri Sai baba saved him from many accidents and health disorders.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, he has established Viswa Sai Dwarakamai as a non-profit spiritual organization under federal laws of Canada to serve mankind and world peace.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Know yourself and see me in yourself&rdquo;, &ldquo;Love All and Live with All&rdquo;, are nectar like words uttered by Shri Shirdi Sai Baba. Spreading this message worldwide forms the basis of Viswa Sai Dwarakamai non-proft organization.</p>
                            <p>Since Shirdi Sai Baba is omnipotent and omnipresent throughout the universe (Viswa Sai), and as this Universe is his place of stay (Dwarakamai), the organization is named as Viswa Sai Dwarakamai.</p>
                            <p>Shirdi Sai Baba is the personification of all gods, all gurus and is Para Brahma and such Shirdi Sai&rsquo;s life is the essence of Sanathana Dharma and summary of all gods. </p>
                            <p>God&rsquo;s benediction and blessings are like a coin. Spiritual inclination is like the &ldquo;head&rdquo; side of the coin whereas serving all living creatures is like the &ldquo;tail&rdquo; side of the same coin. According to Shri Laxmoji Garu only if both sides are in equal balance the value of the coin is complete and mankind would be graced by God&rsquo;s love and benediction. He also says that Bhakti (Devotion) is not weakness rather it is a strength (Shakti) that can be used for the benefit of society as shown by Shri Shirdi Sai Baba in practice till last breath should be followed by all. It is his firm belief that spiritual inclination and serving all living creatures are the very basis of god&rsquo;s invocation and self-realization. He also emphasizes that a person with humble traits who adopts devotion (bhakti) coupled with service (seva) as his path to find god can easily attain self-realization.</p>
                            <p>Shri Laxmoji is always emphasizes that human being (Jeevathma) and god (Paramathma) are not different and God resides in every being. The path of self-realization is through devotion (Bhakti) coupled with Service (Seva). Thus he propagates the philosophy of serving fellow human beings and all living creatures which forms the core philosophy of Viswa Sai Dwarakamai.</p>
                            <p>God is one, all gods are one, essence of all religions are also one, life (Prana) of all living creatures is one, preaching of all gurus is one and according to Shri Laxmoji if one understands this principle (Tattvam) then all of us can seek a life filled with real happiness. Spiritualism is not just about visiting temples, performing prayers, offering naivedyam, fasting, offering food in temples, researching about god&rsquo;s presence but is all about loving all living creatures, recognizing that god resides in all living creatures, and helping people in need either individually or by collaborating in a group as a community is real spiritualism. Serving the real need is Serving God. Shri Shirdi Sai Baba life adopting these principles to lead his daily is exemplary example for all of us. Hence, Shri Laxmoji is convinced that by adopting such practices in our life can make it filled with peace, satisfaction and happiness.</p>
                            <p>In course of time, Shri Laxmoji experienced Shri Shirdi Sai Baba&rsquo;s omnipresence and pervasiveness. His residence became Sai&rsquo;s Dwarakamai. His heart became Shri Sadguru Shridi Sai Bhagwan&rsquo;s residence and he reduced going to temples or visiting other Gurus. He always chants Shri Shirdi Sai Baba&rsquo;s name and Sings Baba&rsquo;s glory which he is convinced would eliminate Maya (Illusion).&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Shri Laxmoji garu says that either to see Sai Baba or experience him there is no need to go to a temple or such places of worship. Adopting this philosophy, he has made his own residence as Shri Shirdi Sai Baba&rsquo;s home (dwarakamai). Shri Laxmoji garu while personally adopting Shri Shirdi Sai Baba&rsquo;s Tattvam in daily life is also preaching it with fullest certitude to fellow Sai Bandhus, relatives, friends and Viswa Sai family members and taking them along with him on the path shown by Shri Shirdi Sai Baba.</p>
                            <p>Viswa Sai family&rsquo;s is spread across Mississauga, Montreal, Ottawa in Canada and in key cities like San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego, Los Angles, New Jersey, Atlanta, Seattle, Minneapolis, Dallas, North Carolina in America. It is also extending from Dubai in the Middle East and the states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh,Orissa, Bangalore, Chennai in India. Family members of Viswa Sai have experienced Baba&rsquo;s sport (Leelas) and miracles in their daily life.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Adopting this Sai Tattvam in their daily life and practices, Viswa Sai family members are all experiencing Shri Shirdi Sai Baba&rsquo;s complete grace. Guiding and performing miracles Shri Shridi Sai Baba is residing in the homes of Viswa Sai family members.</p>
                            <p>Sai Bhajans, Sai prayers, and Sai Seva are his utmost priorities in life. His greatness lies in adopting and following a demanding self-imposed condition wherein he does not like to visit homes to indulge in mundane social activities and discussions related to unnecessary worldly matters and affairs. His visits are limited to Sai Seva and related spiritual activities.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Leading a simple family life, handling severe work pressures, offering actions and deeds (Karma) to Shri Sainath Bhagwan, remaining as a &ldquo;Karma Yogi&rdquo; (active path of selfless service) building family bonds, taking everyone into Shri Shirdi Sai Baba&rsquo;s path and fold is his life goal and destination. In this process he has placed mankind, society and family above his personal and family needs and has been selflessly working for the spiritual and material well-being of the Viswa Sai family members. Reading spiritual books, evangelizing its essence to everyone and signing Shri Shirdi Sai Baba&rsquo;s glory is his mission.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Shri Laxmoji say that he is indebted to his life partner and spouse Sridevi (Padmavati Gajula). On account of her unstinted support and cooperation, he is able to serve Shirdi Sai Baba. According to Shri Laxmoji garu, she is Sadguru Sai baba&rsquo;s gift to him. Apart from taking complete care of family and responsibilities of his son Sai Rithvik, her support in Shirdi Sai Baba Prayers, Bhajans, Satsangs, Food donations, Homams (pouring into fire) and other spiritual services is on account of Shirdi Shridi Sai Baba&rsquo;s grace on her.</p>
                            <p>Likewise, Shri Laxmoji would like to express his heartfelt salutations and gratitude to all Sai Bandhus who are standing shoulder to shoulder with on this on this path of Dharma and Self-realization. He opines that the love showered by Viswa Sai family members is invaluable. He would like to make a special mention of indispensable love of his spiritual sister Smt. Asha Tayi and her husband Shri Srinivas Tayi. Their relation which started in 2006 is like Baijabai and Sai Baba&rsquo;s relationship. He also acknowledges great love from young nephew Chi. Sai Revanth Kumar Juttukonda who is walking with him in Baba&rsquo;s path from his child hood. Likewise, he shares similar love, affection and respect towards all Viswa Sai family members. Because of past life fruits and positive karma, he firmly believes that in this life, he is fortunate to be a part of this blessed Viswa Sai Family. He emphasizes that the relationship with Shirdi Shirdi Sai Baba is a bond of soul and in all births, he is his god and everything (Sarvassamu).</p>
                            <p>Bow to Shri Shridi Sai. Peace be to all.</p>
                            <p>|| Sai is the Eternal Truth, Sai is Continuity, Sai is Life, Sai is God, Sai is Invincible and Sai is Consciousness ||</p>
